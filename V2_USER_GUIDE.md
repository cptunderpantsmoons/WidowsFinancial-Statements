## 📊 Understanding the Extraction

### Excel Data Extraction
The new system properly handles:
- **Multi-sheet workbooks** (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, etc.)
- **Multi-column format** (Particulars | Notes | 2025 | 2024)
- **Year columns** (automatically finds 2025, 2024, etc.)
- **Account codes** (e.g., "40050 - Trade Sales" → "Trade Sales")
- **Negative values** in parentheses
- **Zero value filtering** (skips zeros)

**Result**: 500+ accounts instead of 4!

### PDF Label Extraction
Extracts all potential account labels from template:
- Skips headers/footers/page numbers
- Removes pure number lines
- Cleans up formatting
- Removes duplicates

---

## 🎯 Fuzzy Matching Explained

The system uses **intelligent fuzzy matching** to map labels:

### Match Confidence Levels

**High (✅)**: Score 90-100
- Exact or near-exact matches
- Safe to generate without review
- Example: "Revenue" ↔ "Total Revenue"

**Medium (⚠️)**: Score 70-89
- Good partial matches
- Review recommended
- Example: "Operating Income" ↔ "Income from Operations"

**Low (❌)**: Score < 70
- Poor matches or no match
- **Requires manual editing**
- You MUST fix these before generating

### Match Score
- **100**: Perfect match
- **90-99**: Excellent match (different word order, extra words)
- **70-89**: Good match (partial overlap)
- **< 70**: Poor match

## ✏️ Editing Mappings

### How to Edit
1. Click on any cell in the **"Matched Account"** column
2. Select from dropdown of all available accounts
3. The value updates automatically
4. Click outside the cell to confirm
5. Click **"💾 Save Changes"** to commit

### Best Practices
1. **Review all Low confidence matches** (filter by "Low")
2. **Check unmapped items** (use "Show only unmapped items")
3. **Fix obvious errors** (wrong account selected)
4. **Add missing mappings** (empty Matched Account cells)

### Filters
- **Filter by Confidence**: Focus on specific quality levels
- **Show only unmapped**: Find items needing attention

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Before Uploading
1. **Check Excel structure**: Ensure Particulars column and year columns exist
2. **Verify data**: Make sure 2025 data is in the correct column
3. **Clean account names**: Remove unnecessary prefixes if possible

### During Review
1. **Start with Low confidence**: Fix the worst matches first
2. **Use filters**: Don't try to review all 500+ at once
3. **Check totals**: Ensure key totals are mapped correctly
4. **Verify revenue/expense split**: Make sure categorization makes sense

### After Generation
1. **Open the PDF**: Verify it looks correct
2. **Check values**: Spot-check a few key accounts
3. **Review sections**: Ensure proper categorization
4. **Re-generate if needed**: You can always go back and fix mappings

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Not enough accounts extracted"
- Check Excel file has proper headers (Particulars, 2025, etc.)
- Ensure data is in the right sheets (Income Statement, Balance Sheet)
- Verify you uploaded the correct file

### "Low confidence matches"
- This is normal for complex account names
- Review and edit manually - that's what the editor is for!
- Use the dropdown to select correct account

### "PDF sections look wrong"
- Some accounts may be miscategorized (income vs balance sheet)
- This is based on keywords in the Template Label
- You may need to manually categorize in future iterations

### "Values don't match my Excel"
- Check which year column was used (should be most recent)
- Verify the account name matches exactly
- Look for duplicate account names in Excel
