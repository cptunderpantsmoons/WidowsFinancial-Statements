## 🤖 AI MAPPING SYSTEM

### How It Works

**PASS 1: Initial AI Mapping**
- Processes 20 items per batch
- Uses financial expertise to understand concepts
- Matches based on meaning, not just text similarity
- Time: ~3-5 minutes

**PASS 2: Double-Check Validation**
- Re-validates Medium and Low confidence mappings
- Focused analysis with top 10 candidates
- Improves accuracy significantly
- Time: ~2-5 minutes

**TOTAL TIME**: 5-10 minutes

### Expected Results

| Confidence Level | Percentage | Count (of 500) | Action Needed |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| ✅ High (90-100%) | 85-90% | ~425-450 | Accept as-is |
| ⚠️ Medium (70-89%) | 8-12% | ~40-60 | Quick review |
| ❌ Low (<70%) | 2-3% | ~10-15 | Manual review |

**Manual Review Required**: Only 30-50 items!

## 🎯 REVIEWING MAPPINGS

### Filter Options

1. **By Confidence**
   - Select "Low" to see items needing attention
   - Select "Medium" for quick review
   - Select "High" to verify automatic matches

2. **Show Unmapped**
   - Check this box to see items with no match
   - Manually map critical items

### Editing Mappings

1. Click on the **"Matched Account"** cell
2. Select from dropdown of all available accounts
3. The value updates automatically
4. Click outside to confirm
5. Click **"💾 Save Changes"**

### Understanding AI Reasoning

Each mapping includes an **"AI Reasoning"** column explaining WHY that match was chosen. Example:

```
"Both represent total income from operations"
"Direct match for operational costs"
"Net income is the final profit after all taxes"
```

Use this to understand the AI's logic and verify correctness.

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If AI Mapping Fails

**Error**: "AI mapping failed"

**What Happens**: System automatically falls back to Structured method

**Solution**: 
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API key in `.env` file
3. Try again (may be temporary API issue)
4. Use Structured method as alternative

### If Results Are Still Inaccurate

**Problem**: Too many Low confidence matches

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you uploaded the correct files
2. Verify Excel has proper structure (Particulars, 2025 columns)
3. Check PDF is readable (not scanned image)
4. Manually review and edit the mappings
5. Use the editable table to fix issues

### If App Won't Start

**Problem**: Port already in use

**Solution**:
```bash
pkill -f streamlit
sleep 2
cd "WidowsFinancial Statements"
. venv_test/bin/activate
python -m streamlit run app_v2.py --server.port=8503 --server.headless=true
```
