## 🤖 Method 1: AI-Powered Mapping (RECOMMENDED)

### What It Does
- Uses **Alibaba Tongyi DeepResearch 30B** (FREE model)
- Understands financial concepts and relationships
- Processes in batches of 50 for context
- Provides reasoning for each match

### How It Works
1. Sends template labels + account list to AI
2. AI understands financial meaning (not just text matching)
3. Maps based on accounting principles:
   - Revenue ↔ Sales ↔ Income
   - Expenses ↔ Costs
   - Assets hierarchy
   - Liability types
   - Equity components

### Example Mappings
```
Template: "Total Revenue"
→ AI matches to: "Revenue from Sales" (95% confidence)
Reasoning: "Both represent total income from operations"

Template: "Operating Expenses"  
→ AI matches to: "Expenses - Operating" (92% confidence)
Reasoning: "Direct match for operational costs"

Template: "Net Income"
→ AI matches to: "Profit After Tax" (90% confidence)  
Reasoning: "Net income is the final profit after all taxes"
```

### Advantages
✅ Understands synonyms (Revenue = Sales = Income)  
✅ Handles account codes (ignores "40050 -" prefixes)  
✅ Recognizes hierarchy (Total Assets includes Current Assets)  
✅ Provides reasoning for review  
✅ Most accurate method  

### Limitations
⚠️ Slower (1-2 minutes for 500 labels)  
⚠️ Requires API key  
⚠️ Processes in batches (50 at a time)

## 🏗️ Method 2: Structured Mapping (FAST & GOOD)

### What It Does
- Categorizes accounts by financial type
- Matches within same category first
- Uses enhanced fuzzy matching with category boost

### Financial Categories
1. **Revenue**: revenue, sales, income, fees, turnover
2. **Expense**: expense, cost, depreciation, interest, tax
3. **Asset**: asset, cash, receivable, inventory, property
4. **Liability**: liability, payable, loan, debt
5. **Equity**: equity, capital, retained, reserve, share

### How It Works
1. Categorizes template label (e.g., "Total Revenue" → Revenue category)
2. Categorizes all Excel accounts
3. Searches within same category first
4. Uses weighted scoring (token_set 70% + partial 30%)
5. Boosts score 10% for category match

### Example
```
Template: "Operating Expenses" (categorized as Expense)
Searches only in Expense accounts:
  - "Expenses - Operating" → 95% match ✅
  - "Administrative Expenses" → 75% match
  - "Cost of Sales" → 60% match
Best: "Expenses - Operating"
```

### Advantages
✅ Much faster than AI (5-10 seconds)  
✅ No API required  
✅ Good accuracy (understands financial structure)  
✅ Works offline  
✅ Category column helps review  

### Limitations
⚠️ Less intelligent than AI  
⚠️ May miss cross-category relationships  
⚠️ No reasoning provided  

---

## 🔤 Method 3: Basic Fuzzy Matching

### What It Does
- Simple text similarity scoring
- No category understanding
- Fastest method

### How It Works
1. Compares template label to all accounts
2. Calculates text similarity score (0-100)
3. Returns best match

### When to Use
- Quick testing
- Simple account structures
- When speed is critical
- Offline with no API

### Advantages
✅ Fastest (1-2 seconds)  
✅ No dependencies  
✅ Works anywhere  

### Limitations
❌ Least accurate  
❌ No financial understanding  
❌ Misses synonyms  
❌ No category logic

## 🎯 Which Method Should You Use?

### For Paniri Financial Statements

**RECOMMENDED: AI-Powered Method**

Why?
- Complex account structure (12 sheets)
- Account codes (40050 -, 79584 -, etc.)
- Many similar accounts need context
- You have 500+ accounts to map
- Accuracy matters more than speed
- You have API key configured

**Alternative: Structured Method**

Use if:
- You want faster results
- You'll manually review anyway
- API is unavailable
- You've tested and it works well enough

**Avoid: Basic Fuzzy**
- Too inaccurate for complex statements
- Only for quick tests

- High Confidence: 70-80% of mappings
- Medium Confidence: 15-20%
- Low Confidence: 5-10%
- **Manual review needed: ~50-100 items**

### Structured
- High Confidence: 50-60%
- Medium Confidence: 30-35%
- Low Confidence: 10-15%
- **Manual review needed: ~100-150 items**

### Basic Fuzzy
- High Confidence: 30-40%

## 🛠️ Tips for Best Results

### Before Mapping
1. ✅ Upload correct files (2024 PDF + 2025 Excel)
2. ✅ Verify Excel has proper structure
3. ✅ Check API key is configured (for AI method)

### During Mapping
1. ⏳ Be patient with AI method (1-2 minutes)
2. 👁️ Watch the progress indicator
3. 📊 Review the statistics after extraction

### After Mapping
1. 🔍 Filter by "Low Confidence" first
2. ✏️ Fix obvious errors
3. 🔍 Check "Show only unmapped items"
4. 💾 Save changes before generating

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### AI Mapping Fails
**Error**: "API error" or "AI mapping failed"

**Solutions**:
1. Check API key in `.env` file
2. Verify internet connection
3. Model might be rate-limited (try again in 1 minute)
4. Falls back to Structured method automatically

### Low Accuracy Even with AI
**Possible Causes**:
1. Template labels are too vague
2. Excel account names are very different
3. Many custom account codes

**Solutions**:
1. Use AI method (best chance)
2. Manually review Medium/Low confidence items
3. Edit incorrect mappings in the table
4. Consider creating a mapping template for reuse

### Structured Method Not Working Well
**Possible Causes**:
1. Accounts don't fit standard categories
2. Custom naming conventions

**Solutions**:
1. Try AI method instead
2. Manually edit the category-based matches
3. Use search/filter to find related accounts

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use AI First, Then Review
1. Run AI mapping method
2. Sort by Confidence (Low to High)
3. Fix only the Low confidence items (~50-100)
4. Accept High confidence items as-is

### Tip 2: Learn from AI Reasoning
- Check "AI Reasoning" column
- Understand why AI made choices
- Apply same logic to manual fixes

### Tip 3: Save Time with Filters
- Filter by "Low" → Fix critical issues
- Filter by "Medium" → Quick review
- "Show unmapped" → Fill in blanks

### Tip 4: Category Column (Structured Method)
- Verify category makes sense
- Revenue items should be in Revenue section
- Helps catch mis-categorizations

### Tip 5: Batch Review
- Don't try to review all 500+ at once
- Focus on:
  1. Revenue items (most important)
  2. Key totals (Total Assets, Net Income)
  3. Large value items
  4. Low confidence matches
